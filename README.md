# JS Self-Profiling: Safe Markers in Non-Isolated Contexts — Timeline Visualisation

This fork extends Victor's functional marker test with an **interactive visual timeline** to make it easier to see exactly when and how often each marker type fires, and to inspect the call stack behind each sample.

## What this fork adds

### Two-section timeline

After running the profiling test, every collected sample is plotted on a canvas timeline — one horizontal lane per category, left-to-right by timestamp. The timeline is split into two sections separated by a divider:

**Explicit markers** — lanes driven directly by `sample.marker` (set by the browser):

| Lane | Colour | When present |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `layout` | 🟢 green | always (COI and non-COI) |
| `style` | 🔵 blue | always |
| `gc` | 🔴 red | COI only |
| `paint` | 🟡 yellow | COI only |
| `script` | 🟣 dark purple | COI only |

**Inferred** — lanes for samples with no `marker` field, classified by inspecting the leaf stack frame:

| Lane | Colour | Heuristic |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `js (exec)` | 🟣 light purple | leaf frame has a script resource — JS execution with suppressed `script` marker |
| `compile` | 🟠 orange | leaf frame name matches V8 compiler/parser internals (`(compile)`, `(bytecode compiler)`, etc.) |
| `native cb` | 🔵 teal | leaf frame has no script resource — host/Web API callback invoked from JS |
| `idle` | ⬛ blue-grey | no stack captured |

Explicit markers are drawn as **solid filled rects**; inferred lanes as **outlined rects** (lower opacity) to make the distinction immediately visible. The legend is **clickable** — toggle any lane on/off.

### Why inferred lanes exist

In the Chromium implementation ([`profiler_trace_builder.h`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/1f1f610cb6a035a830c85523e5e59e25446ed2bf/third_party/blink/renderer/bindings/core/v8/profiler_trace_builder.h)), `VMStateToMarker()` maps V8's internal `StateTag::JS` and `ATOMICS_WAIT` to the `script` marker — i.e. any ordinary JS execution gets `marker: "script"`. However only two states produce *no* marker at all from `VMStateToMarker`: everything that isn't `JS`, `ATOMICS_WAIT`, or `GC`.

Outside COI, `ProfileMarkerToPublicMarker()` strips all markers except `layout` and `style` to `nullopt`. This means samples that *would* carry `marker: "script"` in a COI context arrive with no marker field — yet they still have a `stackId`, because stack capture is independent of marker filtering. The same applies to compiler overhead (`COMPILER`, `BYTECODE_COMPILER`), native callbacks (`EXTERNAL`), and idle samples.

The inferred lanes recover this information from the stack:

- **`js (exec)`** — no marker + leaf frame has a script resource → suppressed `script` marker (V8 was in `StateTag::JS`)
- **`compile`** — no marker + leaf frame name is a V8 compiler/parser synthetic (`(compile)`, `(bytecode compiler)`, `(parser)`…) → compiler/JIT overhead
- **`native cb`** — no marker + leaf frame has no script resource → `StateTag::EXTERNAL`, a host API callback called from JS
- **`idle`** — no marker + no stack → truly idle, nothing executing

### Hover tooltip

Hovering a sample dot shows:

- **Lane pill** (coloured) + **explicit / inferred badge**
- **Meta row**: timestamp · raw `marker` value · `stackId`
- **Reason callout** (inferred lanes only): explains which heuristic classified this sample and why
- **Call stack** resolved from the profiler trace's linked-list structure, displayed leaf-first with file/line/column. For `compile` and `native cb` lanes the leaf frame is annotated with `← drove lane classification`.
- **Source snippet**: the 5 lines of source around the leaf frame's line/column, with a `^` caret at the exact column. Fetched on demand and cached — only shown when the resource URL is same-origin fetchable.

### Stats bar

A summary row shows total sample count and a per-lane breakdown, updated on every run.

### Responsive & HiDPI-aware

The canvas redraws on window resize and is scaled by `devicePixelRatio` to stay sharp on retina displays.

## What changed in Chromium (from Victor's work)

The JS Self-Profiling API's `ProfilerSample.marker` field was previously gated entirely behind Cross-Origin Isolation. This CL moves filtering to runtime — `layout` and `style` markers are now available in all contexts because their timing is already observable through existing APIs (`getBoundingClientRect`, `getComputedStyle`, etc.), while `gc`, `paint`, and `script` remain behind COI.

| Context | `layout` | `style` | `gc` | `paint` | `script` |
|---------|----------|---------|------|---------|----------|
| Non-isolated (no COOP/COEP) | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Cross-Origin Isolated | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Running the demo

### 1. Start the server

```bash
node test-server.cjs
```

| Route | COI | Expected explicit markers |
|-------|-----|--------------------------|
| `http://localhost:8123/no-coi` | ✗ | `layout`, `style` |
| `http://localhost:8123/coi` | ✓ | `layout`, `style`, `gc`, `paint`, `script` |

### 2. Launch Chrome Canary with the required flags

```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary \
  --enable-features=ExperimentalJSProfilerMarkers \
  --enable-experimental-web-platform-features \
  http://localhost:8123/no-coi \
  http://localhost:8123/coi
```

### 3. Click "Run Profiling Test" on either page

The timeline appears below the button once profiling completes. Hover any dot to inspect its stack and source.
